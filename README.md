LCC and biophysical environement in the Arctic and Boreal
=========================================================

Codes and data related to our submitted paper titled as **Ecosystem transitions have significantly changed the biophysical environment of the Arctic and Boreal Region of North America**. This repo is a testbed and my goal is to move everything into a new repo [HERE](https://github.com/hamiddashti/lcc-biophys-arctic) by the end of November. The new repository will be open to public and easy to reproduce all numbers, figures and tables mentioned in the paper. We are on the process to move our data on public repository. We will update the links to data and codes in the paper before the final publication of the paper. 

Meanwhile if you have any question regarding the codes and paper, please feel free to reach out to me.
